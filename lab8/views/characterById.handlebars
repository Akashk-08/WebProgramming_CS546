This page will be rendered when the following route is hit: GET http://localhost:3000/character/:id
The title of the document should be the name of the character. You should have the title set as the <title> element of
    the HTML document.  

    Your page should reference a CSS file, /public/main.css; his file should have at least 10 rulesets you must use at
    least 5 of them on this page. 

    You should have a main element, and inside of the main element, you will have an article tag that has an h1 with the
    character name,  an img which the src is set to the value read from thumbnail.path in the data which is a URL to an
    image for the character.  NOTE: The path in the data is NOT the full image path. You will need to concatenate
    "/portrait_uncanny.jpg" to the end of the image path in the data (see HTML example below). Please see the
    documentation on imagesLinks to an external site..  You will have a p element that contains the character
     description, a h2 that's content says "Comics"  and a ul  for the list of comics. You only need to display the
